Description: Low latency KVM FrameRelay implementation for VGA Passthrough
 LookingGlass enables you to use shared memory to pass rendered frames from a
 virtual machine back to the host system.
 .
 A LookingGlass Host implementation is required to run on the guest virtual
 machine. It is recommended that the client and host versions match. See the
 README.Debian for more information.
