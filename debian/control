Description: Low latency KVM FrameRelay implementation for VGA Passthrough
 LookingGlass enables you to use shared memory to pass rendered frames from a
 virtual machine back to the host system.
 .
 A LookingGlass Host implementation is required to run on the guest virtual
 machine. It is recommended that the client and host versions match. See the
 README.Debian for more information.

Description: Low latency KVM FrameRelay implementation for VGA Passthrough (host)
 LookingGlass enables you to use shared memory to pass rendered frames from a
 virtual machine back to the host system.
 .
 This package provides the LookingGlass Host server for Linux, which supports X11
 (XCB) and Pipewire as backends. It is only needed when running Linux guests
 with Looking Glass - otherwise see the looking-glass-client package instead.
 .
 Note: The Linux host is NOT officially supported upstream!

Package: looking-glass-kvmfr-dkms

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, dkms
Description: Looking Glass KVM FrameRelay kernel driver (DKMS)
 LookingGlass enables you to use shared memory to pass rendered frames from a
 virtual machine back to the host system.
 .
 This package provides the kvmfr kernel driver, for use on Linux hosts. It is
 only needed when running Linux guests with Looking Glass - otherwise see
 the looking-glass-client package instead.

Package: obs-plugin-looking-glass
Architecture: amd64
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}

Enhances: obs-studio
Description: Looking Glass KVM FrameRelay plugin for OBS-Studio
 LookingGlass enables you to use shared memory to pass rendered frames from a
 virtual machine back to the host system.
 .
 This package adds a source plugin for OBS Studio which allows recording the
 looking-glass host session directly from the shared memory.
